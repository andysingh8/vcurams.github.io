                The VCU Men's Basketball Team has been one of the most successful collegiate
                basketball programs in recent years. Their consecutive bids into the March Madness tournament is their proof for it.
                Although they have not won the tournament they have made it to the final 4 before and since then they have always
                been ranked to play in the tournament. This years team is led by players JeQuan Lewis and Mo Allie-Cox. These two hard-working
                individuals showed there were a force to be messed with last year, now this year they will lead the team in hopes of coming out champions. We wish them luck! GO RAMS!

            I still see the Ram's as one of the nation's Elite collegiate basketball programs, and I will work hard to uphold that status.
